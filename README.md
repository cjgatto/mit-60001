# Getting started

This course uses an outdated version of Python and Spyder (a Python editor). This environment have everything you need, however.

First, you'll need to install
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

Clone this repository using `git` and open it with VSCode. 

Install the "Dev Containers" extension by going to Extensions (`ctrl+shift+x`) and searching for "Dev Containers." Once installed, do `F1 > Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`. This will reopen the window and begin building the environment.
